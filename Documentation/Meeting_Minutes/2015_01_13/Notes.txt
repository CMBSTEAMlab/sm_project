Began exploring capacitive sensors.

Used the CapSense library from arduino:

Watched NerdKits light up pumpkin example:

Watched How Capacitive Liquid Level Sensors Work:

Made a capacitive touch sensor to toggle on and off an LED.
Inspired by: 
http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Use-Touch-Sensors-With-Arduino/
Had the students start with the CapSense example and modify to toggle
LED on their own. The students were able to identify that the capacitor
was made up of one piece of foil, your hand and the dielectric is air.

The next step was to make a soil moisture sensor by adding a second piece
of foil and taping both pieces to the sides of tupperware (see pictures). 
The students were able to identify that the soil is now the dielectric and 
that adding water changes the capacitance. After setting it up, we watched 
the sensor readings change in the serial monitor.
