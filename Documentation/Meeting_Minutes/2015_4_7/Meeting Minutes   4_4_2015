Yufu - worked on Meeting Minutes.

Owen - soldered headers onto Arduino nano. then test new arduino. creating housing for arduino nano

Bam Bum BA!! Achievement: "2" working arduino nanos

Ren - looking at and trying to understand the seed grove sensor.

Henry - working on calibrating the capacitive sensor so the values are standard. retest the Arduino.

Nic - working on calibrating the capacitive sensor so the values are standard. retest the Arduino.

Harry - looking at and trying to understand the seed grove sensor.

Gabe - "worked" on Meeting minutes and studied Disney and Minecraft movie trailers and Star Warson YouTube

Luc - helped Owen solder.

How far we have come

capacitive
	Waterproof- Ren Harry and Owen
		spray on?
Code stuff
	Sleeping
	power management
Housing - Owen
	3D print files
	whats inside the housing?

Next week:
Capacitive sensor
	Ren: Changes to pcb design to include voltage divider and updated connections.

At end:
 Owen - developing a housing compartment for final project.
