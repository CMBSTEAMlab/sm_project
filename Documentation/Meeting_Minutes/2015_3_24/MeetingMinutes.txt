Henry, Ren, and Harry: Henry worked on perfecting the soil sensor setup. The data values
didn't present any change in moisture value. One possible reason could be an 
error in the circuits setup itself. Another plausible reason might be the 
flooding of the soil. Ren and Harry attempted to augment the circuitry of the 
soil sensor.

EDIT: The issue was due to cicuitry being incorrect

Luc, Yufu, and Gabe: We all worked on documenting any changes to code, or
issues that arose. 

Owen: Owen is resoldering a soil sensor because of the inseficiency of the
previous solderer.
