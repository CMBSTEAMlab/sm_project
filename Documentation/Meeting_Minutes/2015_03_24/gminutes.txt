Henry, Ren, and Harry: Henry worked on perfecting the soil sensor setup. The data values didn't present any change in moisture value. One possible reason could be an error in the circuits setup itself. Another plausible reason might be the flooding of the soil. Ren and Harry attempted to augment the circuitry of the soil sensor.
EDIT: The issue was due to cicuitry being incorrect

Luc, Yufu, and Gabe: We all worked on documenting any changes to code, or issues that arose (other wiseknown as meeting minutes). 

Owen: Owen is resoldering a soil sensor because of the inseficiency of the previous solderer. He is also testing the capasitive sensor that he just soldered.

Yufu and Owen: Calibrated Capasitive sensor.
THOUGHTS:Added water. Max 7oz. before max-out?
